      <h3>当你做一件事儿的时候, 千万不要思考人生, 只要一思考人生, 这件事就很难做成, 因为万事最重要的部分, 无非是不带情绪的去执行罢了。没能坚定做一件事, 是很多人一生不断失败的最大根源, 甚至没有之一。</h3>

      <p>Startup Entrepreneur for over a decade here.</p>

      <p>It&apos;s really fucking hard to live this life.</p>

      <p>Its hard to find a good business idea. It&apos;s hard to leave a paying job and be without revenues for months or years while you start the company. It&apos;s hard to go from a 9-5pm to working 10h+/day 7 days a week because there is so much to do and so few people to do it. It&apos;s hard to sleep every night wondering if your company is ever gonna have revenues. It&apos;s hard to obtain funding. It&apos;s hard to keep a consistent growth curve. And 90%+ of startup will fail, taking their founders&apos; investment and time with them.</p>

      <p>As an entrepreneur, you&apos;re most likely to earn less than half what you&apos;d earn as an employee, for years.</p>

      <p>It&apos;s not for everybody, and I&apos;d say it&apos;s not for most people. It takes a combination of the right mindset, talent/experience, good idea and luck. It takes believing in yourself and your venture enough to potentially live in poverty and stress for years until it takes off.</p>

      <p>But if you&apos;re among the lucky ones, it might pay off in the end.</p>

      <p>I have 3 failed ventures, 9 years down the drain with nothing to show for it besides experience. My 4th one, the latest one, now has 50+ employees, a $25M series B and half a million in weekly sales. 9 years of failures and another 3 years of hard work after that to get here. If I had given up at anytime during those 9 years of failure, if I hadn&apos;t kept trying, I wouldn&apos;t be here with a success at last. But how many people would be willing to fail for nearly a decade without giving up? A job is nice, safe and comfy in comparison.</p>
